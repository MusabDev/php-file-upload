Commodore Nutt (April 1, 1848 â€“ May 25, 1881) was an American entertainer. He was born George Washington Morrison Nutt in New Hampshire. 
He was a midget. In 1861, he was touring New England with a circus when P. T. Barnum hired him to appear at the American Museum in New York City. 
Barnum gave Nutt the stage name Commodore Nutt, a wardrobe that included naval uniforms, and a miniature carriage in the shape of an English walnut. 
Nutt became one of the Museum's major attractions.

Simple does not mean short. Writing in Simple English means that simple words are used. It does not mean readers want basic information. 
Articles do not have to be short to be simple; expand articles, add details, but use basic vocabulary.
Be bold! Your article does not have to be perfect, because other editors will fix it and make it better. 
And most importantly, do not be afraid to start and make articles better yourself.
